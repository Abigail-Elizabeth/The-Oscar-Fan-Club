            <h2>Brief History</h2>
            <p>
                The Oscar Fan Club was born when five newly acquainted girls were notified that their haven was to be
                disrupted by the arrival of a <em>guy</em> roommate. His name was Oscar and he was supposed to be a
                first-year. Days were spent speculating, anticipating, dreading, and to be completely honest, unfairly
                pre-judging the poor lad. In the end, it became an inside joke, and Oscar never moved in. We still don't
                know what happened to him, but such is the etymology of the Oscar Fan Club.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, this is just how the name came to be. The less interesting real story is that the five of us
                clicked well. Yep, just plain old human connection. But given the amount of horrendous stories we've all
                heard about roommate experiences, I think we're well within our rights to celebrate these friendships.

            <section class="one">
                <h3>Maïlys (NOT Maïly's or Maïly)</h3>
                <img src="images/main_characters/mailys_image.jpeg" alt="A picture of Maïlys and her cat Vallica" />
                <p>
                    Maïlys is a third year Geography student from France who has recently become obsessed with playing
                    geo-guesser. She is living it up in Cork because she has only <em>three</em> days of classes a week,
                    much to everyone else’s annoyance. She loves cats, cheese, and is the funniest person in every room.
                    She's also pescatarian, and when she eats her plate full of leaves she looks like an adorable little
                    rabbit.

                <img src="images/main_characters/oscar_image.jpeg" alt="A picture of Oscar le mouton - a sheep plushie" />
                <p>
                    Oscar is Maïlys’ adopted son whom we found on an adventure in Kinsale. He was named Oscar after
                    <i>the Boy Who Never Showed</i> but he is his own person and we all love him. He is part Irish, part
                    French. He stays with his mom but he does have his own room in the apartment. He is really good at
                    parkour which his aunt Marie taught him. And just in case you haven’t realised, he is a stuffed
                    sheep plushie.

                <img src="images/main_characters/marie_image.jpeg" alt="A picture of Marie in a bright green poncho" />
                <p>
                    Marie is a second year Chinese language student from France who is obsessed with sheep, pandas and
                    climbing. Marie got Abi into climbing and now they’re trying to convert everyone else. She’s always
                    looking for a cathedral to visit or a hike to undertake. Marie is also allergic to entirely too many
                    things. Between Abi’s pickiness, Maïlys being a pescatarian, and Marie's allergies, it is <b>SO</b>
                    hard to find something we can all eat.

                <h3>Carol (Baby of the house no. 1)</h3>
                <img src="images/main_characters/carol_image.jpeg" alt="A picture of Carol holding up a heart" />
                <p>
                    Carol is a first year Engineering student from Singapore who is, at any given time, either studying
                    or sleeping. Her stress management is washing dishes. Because of her, we all fight over doing the
                    dishes because we look like terrible roommates in comparison. She cooks uncommonly well, and always
                    has food ready in all of two minutes. Maïlys and her should start a comedy double act. Everyone now
                    knows how to draw the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankine_cycle">Rankine cycle</a> because of her endless practice on the kitchen whiteboard.

                <h3>Abigail (Baby of the house no. 2)</h3>
                <img src="images/main_characters/abi_image.jpeg" alt="A picture of Abigail eating chicken katsu" />
                <p>
                    Abigail is a first year Computer Science student from India. She texts like a dad and is allergic to
                    using emojis. She can sing whistle notes, and is unfortunately, always doing so. She hasn’t adjusted
                    to the cold fully, so she’s always bundled up like a giant teddy bear. She’s always drinking either
                    sprite or apple juice. She’s also a <em>very</em> picky eater, which thoroughly annoys her sister
                    when she
                    cooks for them.

                <h3>Ruth (aka. Ruthie)</h3>
                <img src="images/main_characters/ruthie_image.jpeg" alt="A picture of Ruth stuffing her face with a burger" />
                <p>
                    Ruth is a final year Biochemistry student and also Abi’s older sister. She can't stomach coffee but
                    still adds it into all her smoothies. She is a fan of dancing but not very good at it, and she
                    drinks milk when she’s thirsty. She is the mom of the group and everyone’s emergency contact.
                    Everyone is waiting for her to get her driver's licence so we can go on road trips without depending
                    on buses.
