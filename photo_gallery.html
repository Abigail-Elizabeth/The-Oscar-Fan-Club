                Can't remember if we were watching Crazy Rich Asians or Barbie in a Mermaid Tale. Slowly making
                our way through the 20-something-long movie list. The list expands faster than we can shrink it.

                Unravelling and testing the fairy lights for Christmas. We turned the apartment upside down looking for
                batteries. All that just to get an &euro;8 pre-lit two foot tall tree from Lidl (No traffic cones here,
                no sir.)

            <figcaption>
                Missed the bus to Fort Camden and had to wait an hour for the next one. A fantastic start to the
                adventure. Got 10k steps in before even starting the hike.

                First pub together! Food was had, drinks were drank, and everyone danced themselves silly (not
                pictured). The live band played Bryan Adams at Ruthie's request and she nearly cried.

                Why are there so many stairs in Ireland? At least this one was colourful, and we got a cute photo out of
                it.

            <figcaption>
                Abigail's first (and Marie's umpteenth) hike to the Gap of Dunloe. Abigail nearly fell on her face
                multiple
                times. Marie took several hundred pictures. It was beautiful, and there were so many rainbows that day.

                Taking home flowers for their aunt's birthday. Fell asleep and ended up with a surprisingly artistic
                looking photo (credits to Marie)

            <figcaption>
                Unexpected diwali celebration in the common room with homemade Indian food! Played ping-pong afterwards
                and managed to hit the one and only ball over the air vent. A kind (tall) Frenchman helped us get it
                down, along with the other 4 missing ones.

                Takeout night - everyone had Indian and Carol had Japanese. The restaurant was all out of banana
                fritters (pazhampori) and Ruthie was sad about it.
