            <h2>Northern Lights</h2>

            <p>
                On 11th October 2024, the northern lights were visible across the UK and Ireland! Determined to see the
                lights in all their glory, we trekked (walked) all the way up Patrick’s hill, and set up camp (two
                jackets on the ground). Everyone must’ve had the same idea because it was pretty packed for a random
                spot at 10 pm. We set up our cameras for those beautiful long exposure shots, and opened up the snacks
                as we waited.
                
                Disappointed was an understatement.
                
                Not one single speck of light presented itself, and in true Irish fashion, the clouds mocked us from
                above. We took the last bus back, and were greeted by the same bus driver who took us in. “Didn’t I pick
                you girls up earlier?”. Apparently we were loud enough to leave an impression.

            <h2>Fort Camden</h2>
            <img src="images/blogs/fort_camden.jpeg" alt="Maïlys, Marie, Abigail and Ruth pose behind a hole in the wall" />
            <p>
                On 9th November 2024, we were supposed to go on the Ballycotton cliff walk. However, due to
                unprecedented circumstances (everyone’s general lack of desire to catch a bus at 7 am), we took the 220
                straight to Camden! Well, almost. We missed the bus by about 15 seconds (you should’ve seen Ruthie run),
                so we walked into town and got breakfast before catching the next bus to Camden. It was a gloomy drizzly
                day, but there isn’t much that can take away from the simple joy of seaside air.
                
                Immediately upon arrival we noticed that the little town had tons of semi-abandoned traffic cones.
                Maïlys, who had been insisting that we get a traffic cone to dress up as a Christmas tree, reiterated
                this very important need of the household.
                
                We did not let her steal any traffic cones.
                
                We walked along the Crosshaven cliff loop, and much to our delight, the tide was out so the beach was
                open! Shoes were kicked off, trousers rolled up, and we attempted to frolic in the 9 degree water. Of
                course, that got old pretty fast, so we sat on the rocks and had our lunch. After two hours on the
                beach, we made our way back to the bus stop, at which point Marie managed to pull off an insanely
                efficient Cathedral visit, and Ruthie got food from a fish and chips shop (shout out to Chish N Fips,
                Crosshaven).
                
                The day concluded as we told Carol (who stayed back on account of a pesky assignment) about our day and
                emptied our pockets of rocks and shells from the beach.

            <h2>Engine</h2>
            <img src="images/blogs/engine(1).jpeg" alt="Carol at the kitchen table working hard on her engine" />
            <p>
                The Engine Project was probably <b>the</b> event of the month of November. Carol was supposed to build a
                functional Beta <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine">Stirling Engine</a> for her thermodynamics class. The preparation was immense - soda cans
                were bought, chugged, and cleaned every day, balloons filled, candles and lighters restocked. She spent
                everyday at the kitchen table, making her way through the massive 62 step protocol, trying to explain
                the engine to us laymen.
                
                Eventually, Ruthie and Maïlys got involved, and the three of them worked very hard on the infernal
                thing. Ruthie’s need for perfection translated well into the measurement and step-following, and Maïlys’
                stellar personality and saintly patience made for wonderful emotional support. Everyone stayed up till 2
                am on most days, lighting, blowing out, and relighting candles. Cleaning wax up from the floor. Trying
                not to inhale the dust from cutting up soda cans or steel wool.
                
                In the end, they managed to get the engine running for all of 4 seconds. It was a rather underwhelming
                and unjust conclusion to the herculean effort that was put in. But on the bright side, Carol turned it
                in, and her professor assured them that it doesn’t always work.
                
                Of course, that made nothing better, but at least she’ll get the A for effort!

            <h2>Dumplings</h2>
            <img src="images/blogs/dumplings(1).jpeg" alt="A picture of the homemade dumplings" />
            <p>
                Following a <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> movie night, we found ourselves craving dumplings. However, nobody
                felt
                like spending 7 euro per 10 dumplings from the store, so we got the ingredients and got to work.
                
                Abi made the dough, and Marie whipped up two fillings - one vegetarian and one pork. We sat around the
                table and started making the dumplings in an assembly line. Carol taught us how to fold them, but
                clearly she was a master Dumpling Folder, and none of us could get it right. They were extremely funny
                looking, and there was zero uniformity. We then cooked them three different ways. Marie manned the
                airfryer, Maïlys pan-fried, Abi watched the steamer, and Ruthie made the sauces. And after everyone’s
                patience ran out, we started eating them as and when they were done cooking.
                
                They were extremely delicious. Or maybe we were just hungry. Either way, we got over 150 dumplings for
                under 10 euros, so this was an absolute win for us.

            <h2>Galway</h2>
            <img src="images/blogs/galway.jpeg" alt="Maïlys, Marie, Ruth and Abigail posing with a statue of the Galway girl" />
            <p>
                On 2nd December 2024, we went to Galway to see the Christmas market! We watched the sun rise in Cork as
                we waited for the bus, and were soon on our way. Three hours later, the sun was high in the sky (well,
                about as high as it can get in December) and it was a gorgeous day in Galway. The market wasn’t opening
                till 12, so we made our way to the nearest pub to have some breakfast.
                
                We spent most of the afternoon roaming around the city centre, popping in and out of all the stores.
                Ruthie found a book she’d been looking for at a small family bookshop, Abi got some neat hiking shoes
                (finally!), and Marie went nuts over every claddagh ring shop we passed. We went to every clothing store
                we saw, trying on all the pretty gowns and funky headdresses. We saw the sunset at Mutton Island. Or at
                least, that was the plan. Unfortunately, the clouds were back on their mission to thwart our every
                attempt to experience a light phenomena.
                
                We headed back to the Christmas market, and the whole place was alive! There were lights everywhere,
                painted decorations, and vendors with a whole assortment of knick-knacks. Abi got herself a little
                beanie hat that she wears almost every day now. We got on the ferris wheel and Ruthie had to face the
                fact that she might be slightly not okay with heights.
                
                Finally, we headed into a pub (with live music!) for a quick dinner before speed-walking back to the
                bus, and heading home to Cork.
